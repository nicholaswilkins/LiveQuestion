# LiveQuestion
Very much a WIP
I decided to throw together a client/server kahoot style live Q&A as a nice sunday afternoon project. The main goal of this was to have a Kahoot like experience, but allow for the live addition of questions. This was designed around the use case of having a support coach be able to dynamically ask students questions (and have those student's responses monitored, tracked, and tallied). Finally, this dumps the responses to a handy csv file (or something like it) to allow for analytics and realtime tracking.
